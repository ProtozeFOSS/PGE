#***PGE***
*Protoze Game Engine* - Provides resources and classes to ease building games with *Qt/Qml*

An almost insane :grimacing: but long over due effort to make a game and API engine.

There will be many systems involved and I will make my best effort to document them along the way.



#*Proposed Systems (TBD):*


**Tile Based Map Engine -** [Map System](https://github.com/ProtozeFOSS/PGE/raw/master/docs/MapSystem)
![Tile Map Engine High Level](/docs/MapSystem/images/Map Format and Loading.png)


**Protoze Render Strategy -** [Render Engine](https://github.com/ProtozeFOSS/PGE/raw/master/docs/Render Engine)
![Render Top Level](https://github.com/ProtozeFOSS/PGE/raw/master/docs/Render Engine/images/Rendering Engine.png)

**Protoze Resource Loader -** [Resource Loader](https://github.com/ProtozeFOSS/PGE/raw/master/docs/ResourceLoader)

Resource storage/loading is a crucial part of large games. Artwork and sounds are only one element of the massive resource cache games use.



*... More to come.*

#*Known Bugs and Current Development:*
- [ ] *Establish Engine Design* - Make sure I am not recreating work.
- [ ] *Establish A Team* - it is hard to build a game engine on my own.
- [ ] *Upload to Github* as often as possible to keep transparency
